## Overview
This document defines patterns for integrating multiple MCP servers and enabling seamless knowledge sharing across the ecosystem.

## Integration Principles

### URI Conventions
- Consistent URI schemes across servers
- Hierarchical organization of resources
- Clear namespace separation
- Cross-server referencing capabilities

### Resource Sharing
- Cross-server resource references
- Shared utility functions
- Common configuration patterns
- Dependency management

### Knowledge Flow
- Upward abstraction of successful patterns
- Downward specialization for specific needs
- Lateral sharing between similar projects
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Implementation Patterns

### Server Discovery
- Automated server discovery mechanisms
- Resource indexing and cataloging
- Version compatibility checking
- Health monitoring and status reporting

### Data Exchange
- Standardized data formats
- Common schema definitions
- Validation and sanitization
- Error handling and recovery

### Configuration Management
- Shared configuration templates
- Environment-specific overrides
- Secrets management
- Configuration validation

This enables a cohesive ecosystem where servers work together seamlessly.`;
